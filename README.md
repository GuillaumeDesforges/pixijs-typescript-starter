# Pixi.JS TypeScript boilerplate

_Notice: currently broken, see [issue](https://github.com/GuillaumeDesforges/pixijs-typescript-starter/issues/8)_

I had a hard time setting up a development environment, so I decided to share it.

It can be useful to start from there if you want to start developping a game for browsers quickly.

This setup is supposed to be used with VS Code, as configuration is provided so that you hava all tools set up.

## Requirements

-   Node JS and NPM
-   VS Code
-   Chrome

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Launch the `Complete development` launch configuration.

Putting/removing breakpoints in the `.ts` files with VS Code in `/src` should work.
If it does not, please open an issue.

Edit the TypeScript files, the browser should refresh on save.
